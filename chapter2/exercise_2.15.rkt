;It's hard to say that one program is better than the other in a corrected precision system.
;They should produce the same result as one is a mathematic reduction of another. In this
;case one could say that par2 gives tighter error bounds and that's because it only uses
;R1 and R2 in its calculation whereas par1 uses R1 and R2 twice each.
