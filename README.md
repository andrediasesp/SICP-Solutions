My solutions to the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs book. All the exercises were run in DrRacket which you can download [here](https://download.racket-lang.org/). DrRacket supports collections and fortunately it has a SICP collection which has all the primitive procedures and operators that you find through the book. Check it [here](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html).
It is important to refer that all the exercises were solved with the information the book provides until that point.

While reading the book I also followed the video lectures provided by the MIT Website. You can watch them [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/).
