# SICP-Solutions

My solutions to the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs book.

All the exercises were run in DrRacket which you can download [here](https://download.racket-lang.org/). DrRacket supports collections and fortunately it has a SICP collection which has all the primitive procedures and operators that you find through the book. Check it [here](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html).

It is important to refer that all the exercises were solved with the information the book provides until that point.

While reading the book, I am also following the video lectures provided by the MIT Website and the 61A Berkeley Classes from Brian Harvey. You can watch the MIT Classes [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/) and the 61A [here](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter). You can also grab the Course Reader used in the 61A classes as well as the exercises right [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp09/). It is a fantastic course that doesn't focus on teaching you a specific programming language but rather build into you a different way of thinking about programming in general.
