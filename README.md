# SICP-Solutions
My solutions to the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs book. All the exercises were run in DrRacket which you can download [here](https://download.racket-lang.org/). DrRacket supports collections and fortunately it has a SICP collection which has all the primitive procedures and operators that you find through the book. Check it [here](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html). 
At last, all the exercises were made with only the information the book provides until that point.
